# React/ExpressJS URL Shortener [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/muhanad40/React-URL-shortener.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/muhanad40/React-URL-shortener)

This is not a real URL shortener. It will not shorten any URLs (for spam and laziness purposes). It's just a small toy app built to flex them coding muscles ðŸ’ª

### Local installation
1. `cd React-URL-Shortener`
